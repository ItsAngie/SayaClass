#SAYA Summer of Code!

Learning Objectives - The  Learning objective for students is to understand the value of programming, and apply new programming knowledge practically. (It is not intended to help students master a specific language, but to excite them and immerse them in basic to intermediate web development). The objective is to learn how to learn. Because programming is always evolving and we canâ€™t necessarily foresee what will become popular, the focus is on being able to learn and not on knowing one language per se. For example, html, css, js - common components of a website. Not always the case.. (For this component, just create a repo and have them clone it. Have a pureHtml branch, htmlAndCss branch, and a htmlCssJs branch so that they can see the difference.

Command-line interface - Students will learn basics of interacting with machine via command line (terminal).
Git - Understand how to use git in command line for basic version control
