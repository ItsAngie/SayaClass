Learning Objectives- The  Learning objective for students is to understand the value of programming, and apply new programming knowledge practically. (It is not intended to help students master a specific language, but to excite them and immerse them in basic to intermediate web development). The objective is to learn how to learn. Because programming is always evolving and we can’t necessarily foresee what will become popular, the focus is on being able to learn and not on knowing one language per se. For example, html, css, js - common components of a website. Not always the case.. (For this component, just create a repo and have them clone it. Have a pureHtml branch, htmlAndCss branch, and a htmlCssJs branch so that they can see the difference.

Command-line interface - Students will learn basics of interacting with machine via command line (terminal).
Git - Understand how to use git in command line for basic version control

Modules

1) Intro to CS and web
	- CS - study of solving problems/abstracting - for this class, we’re focusing on web.
	- Brief overview of how html, css, and js interact in websites. (View page source on some websites first then 		create our own game plan for making a website.)
	- First exposure to Git.
	- Hello World example in html. 
	- Hello World example in JavaScript in Chrome browser (intro to variables)
	      HW - Create a website about something you’re interested in.
2) Intro to Programming w/ JavaScript 		-Variables, types, assignment, conditionals, loops), Arrays
		- Methods.
		- Revisit web development to create content that changes based on user input on website.
 Capstone: students create chest sheet for common Javascript operations ( iterate 

3) What do programmers do? - Intro to Algorithms 2 weeks.
		- Sorting and Searching (Visual demonstrations)
		- Find k in an array…Binary Search
		- Smallest value in array
		- Second smallest
	through array, var comparison, etc.)
Capstone: find element in html, run some functions with html element as input.

4) Web Programming  - Html, css, and More javascript (Advanced)
	- Css - additional tips, tools )hover, animation, etc)
	- Combine knowledge of javascript and web to make real things
	- Implement tic tac toe, connect 4?, snake, brickbreaker)
	 Capstone: More adv

Final Project - Students will make a full web app that is published to the web.
