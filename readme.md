#SAYA Summer of Code!

Learning Objectives - Students will learn the value of programming, and learn programming fundamentals by working on a range of web projects. Because programming is always evolving and we canâ€™t necessarily foresee what will become popular, the focus is on being able to learn how to solve problems rather than master a language.
