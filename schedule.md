0) Intro to CS and web - CS - study of solving problems/abstracting - for this class, we’re focusing on web. - Brief overview of how html, css, and js interact in websites. (View page source on some websites first then create our own game plan for making a website.) - First exposure to Git. - Hello World example in html. - Hello World example in JavaScript in Chrome browser (intro to variables) HW - Create a website about something you’re interested in.

1) Intro to Programming w/ JavaScript -Variables, types, assignment, conditionals, loops), Arrays - Methods. - Revisit web development to create content that changes based on user input on website. Capstone: students create chest sheet for common Javascript operations ( iterate through array, reverse array, reverse string, fizz buzz) (Can show the built-in functions for some of these after).

2) What do programmers do? - Intro to Algorithms 2 weeks. - Sorting and Searching (Visual demonstrations) - Find k in an array…Binary Search - Smallest value in array - Second smallest through array, var comparison, etc.) Capstone: find element in html, run some functions with html element as input. (Learn more concise approach w/ query)

3) Web Programming - Html, css, and More javascript (Advanced) - Css - additional tips, tools )hover, animation, etc) - Combine knowledge of javascript and web to make real things - Implement tic tac toe, connect 4?, snake, brickbreaker) Capstone: More adv

Final Project - Students will make a full web app that is published to the web. Extra credit: consumes a popular service of choice (https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)
